# CyberBike Project
## Building CyberBike module reading all data during the ride
Giving bike more features and showing statistics during the ride

## Idea
PLugging the CyberBike module between speedometer and bike wire connector

(Zaddox Digital Speedometer )
Speedometer -> CyberBike Module -> Bike wire conenctor

## How it works 
Based on ESP32 Module inside it will give cool cyberpunk UI showing bike analytics
Also storing the data from bike sensors and everything else

## CyberBike - Open-source bike sensors extensions system
Plug-and-play solution where you can add any sensors to your bike like accelerometer, additional temperature gauge, clutch etc

## Base data CyberBike module give
- Speed
- RPM
- Gear
- Voltage level
- Neutral

  Using this data the riding can be analysed and improved
